# Don'tForget

A super simple todo app specifically made for my needs. Notes are typed on the left and parsed into remaining todos on the right. All todos must come under a date heading and can either be a todo denoted by `[]` or a countdown denoted by `<>`. You will be warned when a todo is a day old without being ticked and will be warned when a countdown reaches the described day without being ticked.
